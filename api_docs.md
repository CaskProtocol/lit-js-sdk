## Welcome

Welcome to the LIT JS SDK API documentation.  To understand how these functions fit together, please view the README in the github repo for this SDK, located at [https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/lit-js-sdk/blob/main/README.md][96]

## mintLIT

This function mints a LIT using our pre-deployed token contracts.  You may use our contracts, or you may supply your own.  Our contracts are ERC1155 tokens on Polygon and Ethereum.  Using these contracts is the easiest way to get started.

### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][97]** 

    *   `params.chain` **[string][98]** The chain to mint on.  "ethereum" and "polygon" are currently supported.
    *   `params.quantity` **[number][99]** The number of tokens to mint.  Note that these will be fungible, so they will not have serial numbers.

Returns **[Object][97]** The txHash, tokenId, tokenAddress, mintingAddress, and authSig.

## LitNodeClient

A LIT node client.  Connects directly to the LIT nodes to store and retrieve encryption keys and signing requests.  Only holders of an NFT that corresponds with a LIT may store and retrieve the keys.

### Parameters

*   `config` **[Object][97]** 

    *   `config.alertWhenUnauthorized` **[boolean][100]** Whether or not to show a JS alert() when a user tries to unlock a LIT but is unauthorized.  An exception will also be thrown regardless of this option. (optional, default `true`)
    *   `config.minNodeCount` **[number][99]** The minimum number of nodes that must be connected for the LitNodeClient to be ready to use. (optional, default `6`)
    *   `config.debug` **[boolean][100]** Whether or not to show debug messages. (optional, default `true`)

### getSignedChainDataToken

Request a signed JWT of any solidity function call from the LIT network.  There are no prerequisites for this function.  You should use this function if you need to transmit information across chains, or from a blockchain to a centralized DB or server.  The signature of the returned JWT verifies that the response is genuine.

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][97]** 

    *   `params.callRequests` **[Array][101]<[CallRequest][102]>** The call requests to make.  The responses will be signed and returned.
    *   `params.chain` **[string][98]** The chain name of the chain that this contract is deployed on.  See LIT_CHAINS for currently supported chains.

Returns **[Object][97]** A signed JWT that proves the response to the function call is genuine. You may present this to a smart contract, or a server for authorization, and it can be verified using the verifyJwt function.

### getSignedToken

Request a signed JWT from the LIT network.  Before calling this function, you must either create or know of a resource id and access control conditions for the item you wish to gain authorization for.  You can create an access control condition using the saveSigningCondition function.

#### Parameters

*   `params` **[Object][97]** 

    *   `params.accessControlConditions` **[Array][101]<[AccessControlCondition][103]>** The access control conditions that the user must meet to obtain this signed token.  This could be posession of an NFT, for example.  You must pass either accessControlConditions or evmContractConditions or solRpcConditions.
    *   `params.evmContractConditions` **[Array][101]<[EVMContractCondition][104]>** EVM Smart Contract access control conditions that the user must meet to obtain this signed token.  This could be posession of an NFT, for example.  This is different than accessControlConditions because accessControlConditions only supports a limited number of contract calls.  evmContractConditions supports any contract call.  You must pass either accessControlConditions or evmContractConditions solRpcConditions.
    *   `params.solRpcConditions` **[Array][101]<[SolRpcCondition][105]>** Solana RPC call conditions that the user must meet to obtain this signed token.  This could be posession of an NFT, for example.

    *   `params.permanant`  

Returns **[boolean][100]** Success

### getEncryptionKey

Retrieve the symmetric encryption key from the LIT nodes.  Note that this will only work if the current user meets the access control conditions specified when the data was encrypted.

## Types



## AccessControlCondition

Type: [Object][97]

### Properties

*   `contractAddress` **[string][98]** The address of the contract that will be queried
*   `chain` **[string][98]** The chain name of the chain that this contract is deployed on.  See LIT_CHAINS for currently supported chains.
*   `standardContractType` **[string][98]** If the contract is an ERC20, ERC721, or ERC1155, please put that here
*   `method` **[string][98]** The smart contract function to call
*   `parameters` **[Array][101]** The parameters to use when calling the smart contract.  You can use the special ":userAddress" parameter which will be replaced with the requesting user's wallet address, verified via message signature
*   `returnValueTest` **[Object][97]** An object containing two keys: "comparator" and "value".  The return value of the smart contract function will be compared against these.  For example, to check if someone holds an NFT, you could use "comparator: >" and "value: 0" which would check that a user has a token balance greater than zero.

## EVMContractCondition

Type: [Object][97]

### Properties

*   `contractAddress` **[string][98]** The address of the contract that will be queried
*   `chain` **[string][98]** The chain name of the chain that this contract is deployed on.  See LIT_CHAINS for currently supported chains.
*   `functionName` **[string][98]** The smart contract function to call
*   `functionParams` **[Array][101]** The parameters to use when calling the smart contract.  You can use the special ":userAddress" parameter which will be replaced with the requesting user's wallet address, verified via message signature
*   `functionAbi` **[Object][97]** The ABI of the smart contract function to call.  This is used to encode the function parameters and decode the return value of the function.  Do not pass the entire contract ABI here.  Instead, find the function you want to call in the contract ABI and pass that function's ABI here.
*   `returnValueTest` **[Object][97]** An object containing three keys: "key", "comparator" and "value".  The return value of the smart contract function will be compared against these.  For example, to check if someone holds an NFT, you could use "key": "", "comparator: >" and "value: 0" which would check that a user has a token balance greater than zero.  The "key" is used when the return value is a struct which contains multiple values and should be the name of the returned value from the function abi.  You must always pass "key" when using "returnValueTest", even if you pass an empty string for it, because the function only returns a single value.

## SolRpcCondition

Type: [Object][97]

### Properties

*   `method` **[string][98]** The Solana RPC method to be called.  You can find a list here: [https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api][113]
*   `params` **[Array][101]** The parameters to use when making the RPC call.  You can use the special ":userAddress" parameter which will be replaced with the requesting user's wallet address, verified via message signature
*   `chain` **[string][98]** The chain name of the chain that this contract is deployed on.  See ALL_LIT_CHAINS for currently supported chains.  On Solana, we support "solana" for mainnet, "solanaDevnet" for devnet and "solanaTestnet" for testnet.
*   `returnValueTest` **[Object][97]** An object containing three keys: "key", "comparator" and "value".  The return value of the rpc call will be compared against these.  The "key" selector supports JSONPath syntax, so you can filter and iterate over the results.  For example, to check if someone holds an NFT with address 29G6GSKNGP8K6ATy65QrNZk4rNgsZX1sttvb5iLXWDcE, you could use "method": "GetTokenAccountsByOwner", "params": \[":userAddress",{"programId":"TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA"},{"encoding":"jsonParsed"}], "key": "$\[?(@.account.data.parsed.info.mint == "29G6GSKNGP8K6ATy65QrNZk4rNgsZX1sttvb5iLXWDcE")].account.data.parsed.info.tokenAmount.amount", "comparator: >" and "value: 0" which would check that a user has a token balance greater than zero.  The "key" is used when the return value is an array or object which contains multiple values and should be the name of the returned value or a JSONPath item.  You must always pass "key" when using "returnValueTest", even if you pass an empty string for it, because the rpc call only returns a single value.

## ResourceId

Type: [Object][97]

### Properties

*   `baseUrl` **[string][98]** The base url of the resource that will be authorized
*   `path` **[string][98]** The path of the url of the resource that will be authorized

*   `role` **[string][98]** The role that the user would be authorized to have.  The role key must be present but it may contain an empty string if you don't need to store anything in it.
*   `extraData` **[string][98]** Any extra data you may want to store.  You may store stringified JSON in here, for example.  The extraData key must be present but it may contain an empty string if you don't need to store anything in it.

## AuthSig

Type: [Object][97]

### Properties

*   `sig` **[string][98]** The actual hex-encoded signature
*   `derivedVia` **[string][98]** The method used to derive the signature
*   `signedMessage` **[string][98]** The message that was signed
